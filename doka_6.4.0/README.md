# Doka Readme

First of all, thank you so much for purchasing Doka!

We've tried to make [the documentation](https://pqina.nl/doka/docs/) as extensive as possible while keeping it concise as well. If you have any questions after reading it, [do let us know](https://dash.pqina.nl/login/), we're always happy to assist.


## Quick Start

If you just want to get on your way, you can use on of the example projects as a starting point. We've also included integrations with multiple different file upload solutions.


## Package

- The _bin_ folder contains the minified library files made suitable for various project types.
- The _integrations_ folder contains multiple example integrations with different file upload plugins.
- The _examples_ folder contains example implementations in both native JavaScript, React, and Vue.
- The _src_ folder contains the merged library source files, please note that the files will probably still need to be transpiled to work in the browser.

**If you're integrating Doka with FilePond on React or Vue you can use the esm version and don't have to use the included Doka framework components.**


## Support

If you've run into an issue or have a question. No worries, we're here to help you out!

Make sure you updated Doka to the latest version, files are available on the [PQINA customer portal](https://dash.pqina.nl/).

**Please make sure the problem is not related to one of the file upload plugins. To confirm this, please run a test with the basic file input example first.**
