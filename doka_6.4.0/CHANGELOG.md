If you're overriding default Doka styles this update might impact rendering and you might have to prepend your custom doka styles with `.doka--root` to make them more specific.

- Add `cropAllowResizeRect`. Set to `false` to disable resizing the crop rectangle. Useful for when you only want to allow users to scale and rotate the image.

## 6.2.0 | 2020-01-06

- Add `imagePreviewScaleMode`, set to `'crop'` to use actual pixel size of crop for preview image. Set to `'image'` to use pixel size of source image for preview image. Default is `'stage'`, fits preview to stage which matches the current behavior.

- Improve main menu style for narrow viewports. The corners are now rounded and the main action button has a prominent color.


## 6.0.0 | 2019-12-30

Markup style defaults properties have been renamed. This is a breaking change and therefor the major version number has changed as well. Previously the default styles were set using the index of the option in the linked style options list. Starting from this version the value is set using the actual value instead of the index.

This is only a breaking change if you've set different default values for the markup styles.

- Add draw tool to markup view.
- Set default markup style values using `markupColor` , `markupFontSize`, `markupFontFamily`, `markupShapeStyle`, and `markupLineDecoration`.

When the user scrolls or zooms in/out with the touchpad the message is hidden and will not re-appear (Doka will use `localStorage` to remember it has shown the message). Doka will use the value in the `storageName` property as the name for the `localStorage` entry.
- Use `labelCropInstructionZoom` to change the label of the crop instruction bubble.
- Update resize modifier key handling, when the array of key codes is empty the custom resize functionality is disabled.

- Fix issue where status layer would be rendered outside of the editor when in modal mode.


## 5.8.0 | 2019-10-29

- Improve rendering performance and CSP compatibility by using `cssText` instead of `setAttribute` for updating view layout.


## 5.7.0 | 2019-10-10

- Add `cropResizeMatchImageAspectRatio`, when enabled this will automatically adjust the crop aspect ratio to match the image aspect ratio if the user zooms out. Only works if the aspect ratio is set to "free".
